A Bulgarian **Diceware wordlist** for passphrase generation.

## 📌 About

The initial inspiration came from [diceware.com](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html#Diceware%20in%20Other%20Languages).

I didn’t like that the available Bulgarian wordlist was only in **PDF format** with non-selectable text — great for printing, but inconvenient for experimenting or scripting.

So I decided to build my **own Bulgarian wordlist**, reusing the excellent open-source [Bulgarian word dictionary](https://github.com/aquilax/bg-words-dict) by [aquilax](https://github.com/aquilax).

I also wanted to experiment with the process of building a custom wordlist from scratch — and luckily, **Linux provides all the tools out of the box**:
- `grep`
- `awk`
- `wc`
- `shuf`
- `cat`
- `paste`
- …and lots of `less` 🙂
